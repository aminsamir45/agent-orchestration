  "description": "I need an intelligent research assistant system composed of multiple specialized agents that can help researchers gather, analyze, and synthesize information from various sources. The system should include:\n\n1. Information Retrieval Agent: This agent should search and collect relevant information from academic databases, websites, and other sources based on research queries. It should be able to understand complex queries and find the most relevant sources.\n\n2. Content Extraction Agent: This agent should parse and extract key information from retrieved documents, including main arguments, methodologies, results, and citations. It should handle various document formats like PDFs, HTML, and plain text.\n\n3. Analysis Agent: This agent should analyze the extracted information to identify patterns, contradictions, gaps, and relationships between different sources. It should evaluate the quality and reliability of sources based on citation metrics and publication venues.\n\n4. Synthesis Agent: This agent should compile the analyzed information into coherent summaries, literature reviews, or research briefs based on the user's requirements. It should organize information logically and highlight key insights.\n\n5. Citation Management Agent: This agent should properly format citations and generate bibliographies according to different citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, etc.).\n\nThe system should work in a sequential pattern where the Information Retrieval Agent first gathers sources, which are then processed by the Content Extraction Agent, followed by the Analysis Agent, and finally the Synthesis Agent with support from the Citation Management Agent.\n\nThe system should integrate with:\n- Academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, JSTOR, etc.)\n- Citation management tools (Zotero, Mendeley)\n- Document repositories\n- Note-taking applications\n\nThe system should maintain a user profile to understand research interests and preferences over time, and should be capable of handling specialized domains including medicine, law, engineering, and humanities research."
