  "description": "I need an agent system that helps manage tasks and projects. The system should have components that can:\n\n1. Task Collector Agent: This agent should collect tasks from various sources including emails, Slack messages, and manual input. It should extract task details like deadlines, priorities, and descriptions.\n\n2. Task Organizer Agent: This agent should categorize and prioritize tasks based on deadlines, importance, and dependencies between tasks. It should maintain a structured database of all tasks.\n\n3. Reminder Agent: This agent should send timely notifications about upcoming deadlines and important tasks that need attention. It should be able to send notifications through multiple channels.\n\n4. Progress Tracking Agent: This agent should monitor task completion status and generate reports on progress. It should identify bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.\n\n5. Resource Allocation Agent: This agent should analyze resource requirements for tasks and suggest optimal allocation of team members based on skills and availability.\n\nThe agents should work together in a coordinated way where the Task Collector feeds information to the Task Organizer, which then provides data to the Reminder Agent, Progress Tracking Agent, and Resource Allocation Agent. The system should have a central database that all agents can access and update.\n\nFor integrations, the system needs to connect with:\n- Email services (Gmail, Outlook)\n- Calendar applications\n- Slack\n- Project management tools like Jira and Trello\n- Time tracking software\n\nThe system should be able to handle multiple projects simultaneously and provide both detailed views of individual tasks and high-level overviews of project status."
