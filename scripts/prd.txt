# Agent Orchestration App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
The Agent Orchestration App is an AI-powered tool that helps users design and implement custom AI agent systems. The application guides users through defining their agent requirements, then automatically generates visual diagrams and implementation details for orchestrating multiple AI agents to accomplish specific tasks. The core value proposition is simplifying the complex process of agent orchestration by providing visual, implementable designs based on user requirements.

## User Flow
The application follows a structured, conversation-based flow:

1. **Initial System Description**: User provides a detailed description of the agentic system they're trying to build
2. **AI Synthesis (First Pass)**: The system analyzes and interprets the user's requirements
3. **Functionality & Tool Specification**: User selects desired functionality and specific tools via an interactive checklist interface
4. **AI Synthesis (Second Pass)**: The system incorporates the selected tools and functionality requirements
5. **Diagram Generation**: The system creates a comprehensive orchestration diagram showing agent relationships, data flow, and system architecture
6. **Agent Execution Option**: User can choose to run the designed agent system directly from the application

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Single-page application with responsive design
- Clean, intuitive user interface for multi-step interaction process
- Interactive diagram visualization with zoom/pan capabilities
- Form components for text input and checkbox selection
- Progress indicators to show users where they are in the workflow
- Markdown/rich text support for displaying generated content

### Backend
- Multi-agent system architecture for orchestration planning
- Integration with Gemini API for natural language processing
- Diagram generation capabilities (using appropriate visualization libraries)
- Local storage mechanism for saving generated agent configurations
- API endpoints to handle the multi-step process

### Core Technologies
- Gemini API for natural language understanding and generation
- LangChain and/or LangGraph for agent orchestration implementation
- MCP (Model-Control-Prompt) frameworks for agent design
- Visualization libraries for diagram creation (e.g., Mermaid, D3.js)
- Node.js/Express.js for backend services
- React/Next.js for frontend UI

## Detailed Feature Requirements

### 1. Agent System Description Input
- Text area for detailed system description
- Support for markdown formatting in user input
- Character count and guidance for providing sufficient detail
- Option to upload existing documentation or specifications
- Example templates to guide users on required information

### 2. AI Synthesis Interface
- Visual indication of processing state
- Display of interpreted requirements with confidence levels
- Option for users to confirm or correct interpretations
- Extraction and highlighting of key components identified in the description

### 3. Tool Selection Interface
- Checkbox-based tool selection interface
- Support for up to 20 different tools/capabilities
- Custom "Other" field with text input for tools not in the predefined list
- Tool categorization by purpose (e.g., data processing, retrieval, reasoning)
- Brief descriptions of each tool's capabilities and typical use cases
- Real-time updating of selected tools with visual confirmation

### 4. Orchestration Diagram Generation
- Visual representation of agent relationships and interactions
- Clear indication of data/information flow between agents
- Tool integration points within the orchestration flow
- Sequential vs. parallel execution paths
- Decision points and conditional logic
- Support for downloading diagrams in common formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Interactive elements to explore different components

### 5. Agent Execution Interface
- Local execution capabilities for the generated agent system
- Configuration options before execution
- Input fields for test queries/commands
- Output display with formatting
- Execution logs and debugging information
- Option to modify parameters and re-run

### 6. Storage & Management
- Local storage of created agent designs
- Naming and organization of saved designs
- Export/import functionality for sharing designs
- Version history for iterative improvements

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Orchestration Models
The system should support multiple orchestration patterns:
- Sequential (agents operating in a pipeline)
- Hierarchical (manager-worker relationships)
- Peer-based (collaborative agents with equal standing)
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple patterns

### Integration Requirements
- Support for popular AI tools and frameworks
- Extensibility for adding new tools
- Standardized interfaces for tool interaction
- Configuration templates for common agent types

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Response time under 5 seconds for synthesis steps
- Usability: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Reliability: Graceful handling of API failures
- Security: Secure handling of user data and generated content
- Scalability: Support for complex agent systems with many components

## Future Considerations
- User authentication and cloud storage
- Sharing and collaboration features
- Integration with deployment platforms
- Community templates and patterns
- Advanced visualization options
- Performance analytics for agent systems
- Natural language interface for diagram modification
